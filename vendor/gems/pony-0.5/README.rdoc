= Pony, the express way to send email in Ruby

== Overview

Ruby no longer has to be jealous of PHP's mail() function, which can send an email in a single command.

  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :from => 'me@example.com', :subject => 'hi', :body => 'Hello there.')
  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :from => 'me@example.com', :subject => 'hi', :body => '<h1>Hello there!</h1>', :content_type => 'text/html')
  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :cc => 'him@example.com', :from => 'me@example.com', :subject => 'hi', :body => 'Howdy')

Any option key may be omitted except for :to.


== Transport

Pony uses /usr/sbin/sendmail to send mail if it is available, otherwise it uses SMTP to localhost.

This can be over-ridden if you specify a via option

  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :via => :smtp) # sends via SMTP
  
  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :via => :sendmail) # sends via sendmail

You can also specify options for SMTP:

  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :via => :smtp, :smtp => {
    :host   => 'smtp.yourserver.com',
    :port   => '25',
    :user   => 'user',
    :password   => 'password',
    :auth   => :plain # :plain, :login, :cram_md5, no auth by default
    :domain => "localhost.localdomain" # the HELO domain provided by the client to the server
  }

== TLS/SSL

With smtp transport it also possible to use TLS/SSL:

  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :via => :smtp, :smtp => {
    :host   => 'smtp.gmail.com',
    :port   => '587',
    :tls    => true,
    :user   => 'user',
    :password   => 'password',
    :auth   => :plain # :plain, :login, :cram_md5, no auth by default
    :domain => "localhost.localdomain" # the HELO domain provided by the client to the server
  })

== Attachments

You can attach a file or two with the :attachments option:

  Pony.mail(..., :attachments => {"foo.zip" => File.read("path/to/foo.zip"), "hello.txt" => "hello!"})

An attachment's mime-type is set based on the filename (as dictated by the ruby gem mime-types).  So 'foo.pdf' has a mime-type of 'application/pdf'
